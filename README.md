- 👋 Hi, I’m @Crevlorne
- 👀 I’m interested in GameDev, with a special focus on Video Game Music and Sound Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multiple DAWs to create Game Audio, as well as the Unity Game Engine to create my own game prototypes to add music and sounds to!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on local Game Jams in the future to start building a portfolio of quality projects.
- 📫 New to GitHub, but excited to add Version Control to my projects!
